The big thing to note is that I'm going to get a physical riichi mahjongg set before I actually make this. I want to know all the rules before making a sub-par implemenetation of it
Also: It's going to be one of those projects I use to further the 3d engine

4 players

4 suits
Characters
Bamboo
Target
Honors (ESWN winds, RGW dragons)

closed/open hand:
a closed hand is when you have not declared rin/pon/kan (i think) or otherwise 



yaku:
Winning player must have at least 1 yaku, otherwise they lose points (distributed to other players)




winning hand:

4 sequences/matches and one pair

bamboo/1-2-3, targets/1-2-3, characters/8-8-8, 3 norths and 2 red dragons is a winning hand.
If you had no directions and dragons, instead opting for a pon of bamboo/5, and a pair of character/2, then it would be a chambo hand, because there is no yaku (meaning you lose points)

4 sets of 1-2-3 bamboo and a pair of 8 bamboo is a winning hand


declarations:
-Pon
  -Is a set of 3 of a piece (3 bamboo/8)
-Kan
  -Declared when you have a pon of something and the 4th piece of it is either drawn by holding player or discarded by another player
  -I believe you can call kan if you already have declared pon, but only if the piece is in your hand
  -Example: I have a closed pon of bamboo/3 and player N discards a bamboo/3. I declare "Kan".
  -Calling Kan when you have self-drawn the last piece (where you have, say, 4 bamboo/8)
-Tsumo:
  -Self-draw winning tile (be it for a pair or meld), does not need to be closed.
	  A closed Tsumo results in a yaku (menzen tsumo)

-Ron
  -Win by using somebody elses discarded piece

-riichi
  -closed hand (no Pon or Chii)


Han & Fu:
Han and Fu exist for scoring purposes.
While they increase your score, you still need at least 1 yaku to declare a winning hand
