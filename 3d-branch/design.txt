Rendering:
First setup VBOs and VAOs
Check which shader is required
      At this point, I'm unsure of whether or not I'm going to have it be model wide or object wide (i.e. (model-shader-id model) or (object-shader-id object))
      Decision has been made, shaders will be object wide.
      	       The shader subsystem will be a headache to implement, primarily linking objects into the shader groups
