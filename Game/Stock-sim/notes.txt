Stock sim will simulate stock trading

Necessities:

Must be able to organize by column

| Name | Ticker | Price | Change |

Once one of the columns is clicked, it reorders the stock list to display by whatever category was clicked

Name/ticker - A->Z, if already organized by Name/Ticker, Z->A
Price/Change - Low to high, if already, High to low

Clicking on a row highlights that row
