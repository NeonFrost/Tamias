So first off:

Buttons - Very basic UI element, will allow test of: rendering, hover, action

COMPLETED MILESTONE 1 11/22/2020

Labels - Ensures that render:string works correctly and as expected (width & height imply how big you want the text to be, not how big the text is)


Side note: Should the text function use x y as absolute coordinates, or use them as the center?

Entry - Ensure that keyboard input is working correctly


Once the above is done, work on a stock simulator that can:
     -Sort By:
     	   -Name
	   -Price
	   -Change
	   -Dividends
     


Eventually I want to make a gui editor, the gui editor will make it infinitely easier to create guis and edit them

Big thing will be creating a node editor

GUI projects:

-Stock Simulator

-Basic node editor (like cards with text)

-GUI maker/editor (make the GUI side of programs in this)
