So first off:

Buttons - Very basic UI element, will allow test of: rendering, hover, action

COMPLETED MILESTONE 1 11/22/2020

Labels - Ensures that render:text works correctly and as expected (width & height imply how big you want the text to be, not how big the text is)

Works, but make sure that the label UI is (+ text-height (/ char-height 2))
       	   	if text-height = char-height * 3, then thats 48. so label should be 56 pixels tall

Side note: Should the text function use x y as absolute coordinates, or use them as the center? - origin-as-center resolves this issue.

Completed: M2 5/1/2021


Entry - Ensure that keyboard input is working correctly - done
      	Activated entry should have a different color to show that it's in edit mode.
		Branch for whether or not edit mode is on. i.e. keyboard-shortcuts won't work app-wide
		       	   -??? Does it Require modifiying keyboard input function in engine/input ???

Semi-Completed : Needs branching for entry mode, needs text wrapping


Once the above is done, work on a stock simulator that can:
     -Sort By:
     	   -Name
	   -Price
	   -Change
	   -Dividends


Completed: M3 5/5/2021


Get menu-bar up and running and ensure that ui-menu works as expected



Other UI elements need to be created and tested, such as spin box and combo box with radio buttons

Eventually I want to make a gui editor, the gui editor will make it infinitely easier to create guis and edit them

Big thing will be creating a node editor

GUI projects:

-Stock Simulator

-Basic node editor (like cards with text)

-GUI maker/editor (make the GUI side of programs in this)

-Item creator for S'daia (to be ported to 3d)
