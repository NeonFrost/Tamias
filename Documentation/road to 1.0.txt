Required implementations:
Input	 -	Mostly Done     - refactored 
Graphics -	Mostly Done     - 
Audio	 -	Mostly Done     - 
OS interaction (files mainly)	- Mostly Done
Demos - Rendering
      	States
	Input
	Audio
	Physics
	animation

Input:
Keyboard focus until 0.9, where rudimentary controller support will be added
better mouse support - Done?
DONE: Move from :scancode-KEY to :KEY
FIXED: check with os to see if mod keys are being used rather than left/right modkeys (I have the caps lock key acting as a control key and it doesn't register as control.)

Gfx:
Implement cirles and arcs - Check if SDL2 gfx has been ported
DONE, NEEDS TESTING: refactor spritesheet stuff
      	    	     ensure all gfx functions work - IN PROGRESS
		     Cull as necessary - IN PROGRESS

Fix image fonts, implement ttf support - IN PROGRESS

Audio:
Refactor and fix music subsystem (currently not broken, but feels like it needs work.)
make it easier to do stuff with music files

Ensure sfx are easy to use

DONE..Sort Of: implement ability to use multiple extensions (mp3 et al)
	       		 in "Main.lisp" the line (sdl2-mixer:init :ogg), add in either :wave or :mod after :ogg if you need them. 

OS:
Unsure, probably make save files easy to implement (i.e. (save-game "name.EXT" things to save) (load-save-game "file.ext")

Demos:
Self explanatory
One that uses the particle system
Audio: Change tracks, play-sound on key press
Mahjongg (tile matching, not Riichi, but do want to implement it)


change sub-state references to (state-sub-state tamias:state)
