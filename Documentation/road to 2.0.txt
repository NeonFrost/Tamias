Get to 1.0
Convert Tamias source code over to Elk
1.5
Implement 3D backend
1.7
Audio server written in Elk, replacing SDL mixer
1.9
An extensible roguelike will be written

An extensible zelda-clone will be written

3.0 roadmap
All backends written in native Elk as much as possible (i.e. audio server on top of ALSA, gfx on top of X)

At least 2 3D games written along with several 3D demos (one voxel demo, one that heavily uses particles)

One full fledged 3D game (not necessarily visually stunning) written and released
