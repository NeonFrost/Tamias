Required implementations:
Input
Graphics
Audio
OS interaction (files mainly)
Demos - Rendering
      	States
	Input
	Audio
	Physics
	animation

Input:
Keyboard focus until 0.9, where rudimentary controller support will be added
DONE: Move from :scancode-KEY to :KEY
better mouse support
FIXED: check with os to see if mod keys are being used rather than left/right modkeys (I have the caps lock key acting as a control key and it doesn't
       	      	     	    	     	   	       	    	       	        register as control.)

Gfx:
Implement cirles and arcs
refactor spritesheet stuff - Currently being worked on
ensure all gfx functions work - IN PROGRESS
Cull as necessary - IN PROGRESS
Fix image fonts, implement ttf support - IN PROGRESS

Audio:
Refactor and fix music subsystem (currently not broken, but feels like it needs work.)
make it easier to do stuff with music files
implement ability to use multiple extensions (mp3 et al) - CAN'T FIX - As far as I can tell, when sdl mixer is loaded up, it can only handle {ext} and wav files,
	  	     	 	  	     	     	   	       	      	       	     	      	       	      	  ext for music wav for sound
Ensure sfx are easy to use

OS:
Unsure, probably make save files easy to implement (i.e. (save-game "name.EXT" things to save) (load-save-game "file.ext")

Demos:
Self explanatory
One that uses the particle system
Audio: Change tracks, play-sound on key press
