OS interaction (files mainly)
Demos - Rendering
      	States
	Input
	Audio
	Physics
	animation

Input:
Keyboard focus until 0.9, where rudimentary controller support will be added
Move from :scancode-KEY to :KEY
better mouse support
check with os to see if mod keys are being used rather than left/right modkeys (I have the caps lock key acting as a control key and it doesn't
      	      	     	    	     	   	       	    	       	        register as control.)

Gfx:
Implement cirles and arcs
refactor spritesheet stuff
ensure all gfx functions work
Cull as necessary
Fix image fonts, implement ttf support

Audio:
Refactor and fix music subsystem (currently not broken, but feels like it needs work.)
make it easier to do stuff with music files
implement ability to use multiple extensions (mp3 et al)
Ensure sfx are easy to use

OS:
Unsure, probably make save files easy to implement (i.e. (save-file "name.EXT" things to save) (load-file "file.ext")

Demos:
Self explanatory
